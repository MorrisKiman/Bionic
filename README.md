# Metrica
A biometrics attendance system that leverages android for biometrics capture and  verification, Oracle forms for the user interface and Oracle as the database.
Major bases to cover with this project are:
  =>A solid database structure on which the application will be based on
  =>An android app that collects and verifies biometric information
  =>User interfaces for interacting with the system using Oracle forms
  =>PLSQL/Java APIs that will comminicate data between the Android app, the database and the user interface.
For the server, I will be using Oracle Linux 7.9 running Oracle 12c
Oracle forms will be developed on a windows environment since I have been unable to locate Linux versions
